# Backpack - MLM
This the project repo of backpack_mlm. Here we want to train the backpack model using MLM and compare the results of the both in a variety of task including a downstream task.
We have the following ipynb files that test the various aspects of our idea. Till now we have reproduced the baselines and tested the lm model on one downstream task:
1. Control
2. Verb similarity
3. Sense vectors
4. Downstream task ()
## Control
We have testes the control the sense vector has on the model. For further info refer the file named control.ipynb
## Verb similarity
We have tested how the backpack models performs on 2 datasets. For datasets refer similarity_dataset folder and for code refer verb_similarity.ipynb
## Sense vectors
We have also tested what a particular sense vector represents for a word. For further info refer the ipynb file sense_vectors.ipynb
## To be done
Train back pack using MLM and test on above tasks and compare the results
